### Coin Toss

Coin Toss is an app that provides users a list of Initial Coin Offerings (Crypto-currencies that will soon be available) in the near future. Based on data retrieved via the 'ICO bench' API, a search is conducted for the number of times these coins are mentioned on Twitter (via Twitter's API). This allows the app to sort the upcoming ICO's based on the number of tweets related to the coin, while displaying additional useful data. Users can then vote whether they believe the coin will perform or not.

Bottom line: The app reveals upcoming ICO's and their 'popularity' on Twitter, while allowing users to agree / disagree with their forecasted success.
